## Description
1. The main focus of this application is to allow the restaurant managers easily manage their guests reservations. The main features include:
 1. Create: You can head to the top left side of the dashboard and click "New Reservation" which will prompt a screen that allows users to create a detailed reservation:

1. Edit: Once a reservation has been created the user will be redirected to the dashboard page of the date of that reservation. The reservation card on that page will include options to seat, edit, or cancel the reservation.

Upon clicking edit, the app will direct the user to the initial form upon which the user created the reservation, with all fields filled with current and editable information:

1. Cancel: If the user wishes to cancel the reservation, click the cancel button on the reservation, the user will be prompted with the following message which will either delete the reservation or cancel the request to delete it:

1. Assigning Tables to Reservations: Clicking the "seat" button will allow you to assign this reservation a table:

Once the reservation at any table is done with their reservation you can click the "finish" button to clear the table to be available for other reservations:
